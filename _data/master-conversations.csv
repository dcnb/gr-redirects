David,Renier,"I participated in quote/unquote straight rodeos. But when I came to the gay rodeos there are some aspects of my life that I didn't share with people. I wasn't walking around with my boyfriend. <b> It definitely was a place that made me feel safe and secure and able to be the authentic me. </b>",special
David,Hallwood,"We may not see each other for six months to a year, but <b> it's just like old home week when you’re together. </b>",special
Ann,Kinney,"Coming into this and actually being able to participate in the event that I choose... <b> it's a freedom to fulfill dreams. I'm one of those people that, when I'm old and sitting on the porch, I don't want to be going, I wish I would have tried that. And I won't be—I will have tried it. </b> If it's something that I wanted to do, I will have tried it.",special
Ann,Kinney,It's the community that keeps you coming back. All those people out there keep you coming back because it's a big family and we're all real tight. <b> You just know that they're there for you. </b>,special
Ann,Kinney,"It's fun, <b> whether you're getting drug through the mud or the dirt. It's fun. </b>",special
Bruce,Roby,"<b> It's our rodeo family, and they’re the warmest, most loving people you'll ever meet. </b> I've got friends in every city I swear in the country, all from rodeo.",special
Bruce,Roby,"I think it was my idea of <b> the real guy </b>, these guys could ride horses, ride broncs and steers, and dance, and sit and chat and just be open and genuine. You know I was living in West Hollywood when there was nothing genuine about any of that.",special
Bruce,Roby,"You know I list two things that <b> saved my life as an adult </b>. One was finding the rodeo. <b> I was a very lost person for a very long time. Then I found the rodeo </b>  and it gave me purpose, it gave me direction. It gave me amazing family. And then through all of this, in two days I celebrate fifteen years of sobriety, being sober, and without the two of those things, I'm not sure where I'd be.",special
Danny,Lee,"I've always been game for anything frankly. I sky-dived, I scuba-dived, I, you know, anything that comes along, I'll give it a try. So, they signed me up and then again everybody back in the arena, you know, everyone’s all: 'Danny he's never done this before he has no idea what he's doing. He has no clue. He doesn't have any of the gear.' <b> And, you know, a jacket—protective jacket—appeared, helmet appeared. </b>  A wig appeared because you have to put drag on, a wig and a dress and, you know, <b> suddenly there I was ready to do wild drag. </b>",special
Joe,Rodriguez,"I loved horses and always wanted to ride. […] The Capital Crossroad Gay Rodeo Association was very kind in letting me sign up. And the persons working behind the chutes, Travis Gardner, was sort of my involuntary mentor. <b>  He said, 'You want to ride broncs? Okay, let's get you suited up. Let’s get you strapped in. Let's get the rigs on. You don't have a rig? Okay, we'll borrow that guy's rig. You're going to wear a vest or you going to wear a helmet?' </b> So that was my first taste. He got me strapped in and I got my first ride.",special
Joe,Rodriguez,"It's just <b> where I fit </b>. And it may not be for everybody, like your previous question there is some pushback because there are some people who believe that the rodeo is too conservative and it doesn't represent the gay/lesbian community but I tell them that's wrong because <b> we come from the gay and lesbian community and we also happen to be cowboys and cowgirls. </b>",special
Adam,Romanik,"They don’t see me as a person, <b> they see the wheelchair, </b> its usually like turning off a light switch. […] For me it’s also <b> very freeing to be able to go compete, to be able to go and ride, to do what I love to do. </b>",special
Jack,Morgan,"Because AIDS was a big crisis, that and there wasn't a lot of people and a lot of help doing things […] <b> It was us trying to help each other cause there was no federal funding, there wasn't a lot of help. </b> So, that's kind of why we started, so that we could compete with something we do, safe environment, and help one another.",special
Lisa,Smith,And I have met a lot of good people—some of the best people around. <b> They’re definitely family. </b>,special
Ann,Kinney,Well we could always be more physical fit. I don't think I was in bad shape but I could have been in a whole lot better shape than what I was doing. … <b>So when I came off the bronc I actually landed on my shoulder and split my spleen in half. And got up and walked out of the arena…I didn't know that was internal bleeding. </b> I spent at least a week in Albuquerque in a hospital. I had to get surgery and get completely cut open and get my spleen removed and so that was exciting. Didn't stop me—that was exciting. <b> I don't break real easy so that's pretty good. </b>,injuries
David,Renier,"Oh yeah, I've had <b>three reconstructive surgeries </b> on my knees, my arm, yeah, stuff like that.",injuries
Joe,Rodriguez,My bareback bronc ride went wrong. <b> I got stuck in the rig and ended up underneath the horse and getting trampled. </b> They had to life flight me out of the rodeo and flew me to Stanford hospital where I spent the night. … <b> Suffice to say I did not win the buckle that weekend. </b>,injuries
Roger,Bergmann,I spent a night in the hospital after a hard fall in Los Angeles. <b> I collapsed my lung. </b>,injuries
Roger,Bergmann,"Well, after I had gone into my first bar in 1981, in San Francisco, <b>I saw a flyer on the wall for the National Reno Gay Rodeo</b> which was the first gay rodeos that were held. They started in 1976, I believe it was, by a man named, Phil Ragsdale, in Reno, Nevada. And I went to the rodeo in August of 1981 shortly after I had gone into my first bar, because of the flyer that I had seen. So <b>there were about 8,000 people in the stands</b>.",started
Bruce Grumpy,Roby,"I lived on the edge of West Hollywood and I had seen signs for this gay rodeo thing, and I'd seen them for 2 or 3 years. <b>But I thought, you know, pink pansies, purple horses. I don't know about this gay rodeo thing I grew up with real rodeo, I'm not interested.</b> Well, they got me to go with them <b>to the dance</b> at the Burbank Hilton on Friday night, 3,000 people at this dance, men women, and it's men, it's like regular guys …they are just regular people that happen to be gay and <b>that's kind of where I really wanted to find life</b>. And I called in sick the next day and went to the rodeo, I called in sick the next day, and went back. It was like, I found a life.",started
Candy,Pratt,"Well, I didn't know there was such a thing….When you grow up you hear of black rodeo or Indian rodeo or something like that. You know, you don't hear white rodeo, you know, it's just rodeo. So I just thought: ‘Oh, my gosh!’ I thought: <b>‘Gay rodeo are you kidding?’ So I went and I found out…</b>",started
Paniolo Joe,Rodriguez,"<b>It was a culture shock moving to San Francisco. The feeling to me was that I was not fitting in. I was lost in San Francisco.</b> I didn't identify with the Asian community and I didn't identify with the gay community. …So I tried to fit in with the gay community but it still wasn't my crowd. <b> When I got to Sacramento and I saw cowboys and country western night dancing. </b> I mean, it was elbow to elbow. You couldn't dance on the dance floor at places. And the music was great. I knew the tunes. I knew the music. …  </b> So then I thought: ‘Wow! Gay community. Western lifestyle. I just fell into it. </b>",started
Jack,Morgan,"<b>Well, the guys.</b> I mean, so obviously being a gay guy, right, I liked very masculine men and that was probably on it, honestly. That was one of the initial attractions. I was younger and I went to different types of environments and different types of bars, I just saw a lot of superficialness, maybe by their fault, or maybe by the environment. But what I found with Charlie's—and the country western lifestyle, IGRA, rodeo—<b>is that people seem to be a lot more genuine, a lot more caring, and just plain real. </b>",started
David,Renier,"<b>I was in junior rodeo and high school rodeo</b> and then I went and did some open rodeos after high school. And then <b>a friend of mine told me about the gay rodeo</b> and I was 21 at the time and wasn't really sure. <b>I wasn't out at the time, </b> so I wasn't really sure I wanted to be part of it. It was in LA at the time and so I went down. I entered one event just to see if it was something I wanted to do. <b>I did my first event and was hooked.</b>",started
Adam,Romanick,"So, I came out back in the late 90’s early 2000’s, and horses were always the center of my life, okay. Being with my horses, trail riding, showing, etcetera. And... one of the biggest challenges that I found with dating and everything is really trying to find someone, that shares that same love. So I met many people, dated people, been in a relationship with people that really didn’t have that love, and it really was an issue, it really caused an issue. When you own horses, and a lot of horses, it takes hours, it takes money, it takes a lot of things, it’s true dedication. Especially competing in the rodeos, its days of traveling, it’s a lot of expense etcetera. With all of that, <b> I started to explore: how can I find someone that has, shares that same love? </b> … And at that time, I really didn’t get to know anything about the gay rodeo, just that it was out there. … I made it my goal to make sure that I was there [at the Philadelphia rodeo] in 2009, and that was the first rodeo I've ever competed in.",started
Lorrie,King,"My friend said, 'You know, there's this country western bar in town, would you be interested in learning dance, you know, country, line dance and country western couples dance?' And I said, 'Oh, that sounds like fun. I'll go with you.' So we started going there one day a week and taking lessons, learning to dance, and we met people. We had a lot of fun. And then he said, 'Did you know that there's a gay country western bar in town?' I said, 'No, never knew that.' … So we started going there… And pretty soon he said, <b> 'Do you know there is such a thing of gay rodeo?</b> And he knew I knew about rodeo, and I said, 'No, didn't know that either.' He said, 'Well there's going to be one in LA the next weekend. Would you be interested in going?' So I said, 'Okay, Sure. That'd be fun.' <b> So we went and it was so much fun and when I found out there was a charitable aspect that appealed to me and so, just sort of couple things happened at the same time. </b>",started
