Roger Bergmann grew up in Kalispell, Montana, and worked for the USDA--Forest Service for thirty years in California. He is a former president of IGRA and has been involved since the beginning of IGRA. He was a Charter member of the Golden State Gay Rodeo Association and attended the first IGRA conventions. While he competed in some events, he focused on administration and became a certified judge. After coming out to himself, and his friends and family in the early 1980s, he had two relationships which ended sadly. The first was a long distance relationship with his partner Tim, who died from complications from AIDS in 1993. Rogerâ€™s second partner, Eloy, died from a brain aneurysm in 1999. Throughout his IGRA career, Roger has been able to travel to a lot of the rodeos, attending about 14-16 rodeos a year. Roger is currently in a long distance relationship with Angel, who lives in Mexico City.
